Thanks for downloading the Realism Overhaul One-Stop-Config-Shop!

I'm sorry to inform you but these files are currently not working as intended and only the Command Pods:
Forward Fuselage section of the Shuttle Orbiter
Orion capsule of reDIRECT

Are currently working. They are configured for Kerbalism, and the Shuttle Orbiter failed to configure for Deadly Reentry.

Please be aware that these configs are a WIP and are published purely for other people to suggest edits/help me out config wise :P

Listed configs on my Github that are not labelled (WIP) are fully ready for you to use in your Realism Overhaul games!
